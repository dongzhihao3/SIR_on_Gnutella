# SIR_on_Gnutella
### Simulation of a SIR Epidemic process on a Gnutella p2p network.
I simulate a SIR Epidemic process (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) on the Gnutella p2p network dataset downloaded from SNAP[1][2] and try different targeted vaccination techniques to see its effectiveness.
This work was done as part of the course of Digital Epidemiology 2017-2018 from the Master's degree in Data Science at La Sapienza - Universit√† di Roma.
